two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, 
eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or 
novelisations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, 
Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd, 
and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is With a Mind to Kill by 
Anthony Horowitz, published in May 2022. Additionally 
Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young 
James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on 
the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.
